# iObfuscate: Unraveling iOS Obfuscation Techniques

During this talk, I examine multiple examples of Reverse Engineering iOS obfuscation techniques. Obfuscation strives to hide the underlying functionality of applications. This is particularly important in iOS applications that include a plethora of additional symbol data susceptible to reversing. I also release my new repository iOS Reverse Engineering repository!

# iOS Reverse Engineering Repository
The [iOS Reverse Engineering](https://github.com/LaurieWired/iOS_Reverse_Engineering) repository contains a comprehensive wiki on iOS Reverse Engineering. It also includes custom Ghidra scripts for iOS analysis, and even example IPA files demonstrating different forms of obfuscation!
